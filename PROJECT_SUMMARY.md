# PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

## Purpose
Build a reusable, working `AGENTS.md` to drop into all projects, plus an Odoo-specific
companion, so AI coding agents follow a consistent spec-driven workflow. Deliverables
live in `agents/`.

## Current status
Working draft complete and internally consistent. No code/app component — this is a
guidance/skill bundle for agents.

## Repo layout (`agents/`)
- `AGENTS.md` — generic, all-projects guidance.
- `AGENTS.odoo.md` — Odoo-specific companion (testing, source layout, DB/instances,
  acceptance demo). Referenced from `AGENTS.md` via `@AGENTS.odoo.md`.
- `project_context.template.yaml` — template for machine/project-specific values
  (paths, spec docs repo + tag, generic `commands:` block for build/lint/typecheck/
  format/test, Odoo source/scripts, modules). Odoo DB credentials removed — they
  live in `odoo_config.ini` exclusively. Copy to `project_context.yaml` (gitignored)
  per project.
- `.gitignore` — ignores `project_context.yaml` and credential `.ini` files.
- `skills/coding-standards/SKILL.md` — coding standards (currently logging).
- `skills/init-project/SKILL.md` — scan-first workflow to create `project_context.yaml`
  with inferred defaults; asks the user only for what cannot be discovered.
- `skills/specification-methodology/SKILL.md` — 5-step spec writing (Models, Roles,
  Use Cases identification, Use Cases documentation, Review).
- `skills/test-scenarios/SKILL.md` — how to write contractual, customer-facing
  `<epic>_TESTS.md` scenarios.
- `skills/todo-list/SKILL.md` — TDD-based TODO list generator (Red/Green phases,
  Review & Commit checkpoints) for entry-level programmers.

## What `agents/AGENTS.md` covers
- Spec-driven workflow rules: spec is the contract; never fill gaps with assumptions
  (ambiguity is a blocker — ask interactively, one question at a time, unpacking
  complex ones); no mid-flight spec changes; tests are executable spec and tests win;
  work against the docs tag.
- Implementation deliverables: code vs tag, automated tests, development report.
- Build/Lint/Verify: commands sourced from `project_context.yaml` `commands:`; run
  before done; minimal-diff/no scope-creep formatting.
- Definition of Done checklist (tests pass, lint/typecheck/build clean, report written,
  sample files synced, no unsolicited commits).
- Project config via `project_context.yaml` (lives in the project folder, one level
  above the `docs` and `src` repos); maintain `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`.
- Working conventions (use subagents, don't commit without asking, minimal diff,
  blocker protocol — never weaken/skip/mock contractual tests, keep samples in sync).
- Security & Secrets: treat config values (esp. credentials) as secret; never emit them.
- Communication & Output: concise responses, `file_path:line` references.
- Autonomous file/log reading (Read/Grep, no Bash pipes/redirects).
- Skills: `coding-standards`, `test-scenarios`.

## What `AGENTS.md` (workspace root) covers
- Meta-guidance for working on this repo itself.
- Consistency triangle: `agents/AGENTS.md` ↔ `project_context.template.yaml` ↔
  `init-project/SKILL.md` must stay in sync.
- Skills table and Definition of Done for this repo.

## Key source documents
- `AI_assisted_development_workflow.md` (docs/) — the methodology `agents/AGENTS.md`
  encodes. Workspace root with separate docs and source repos; docs repo split into
  `customer-facing/` and versioned `working/`; unversioned workspace-level `local/`
  scratch material; docs freeze tags; 5-step spec methodology; state-table tests;
  multi-layer acceptance; known gaps.

## Design notes / decisions
- `test-scenarios` skill format uses Pre-conditions / Steps with Before/After /
  Expected-result tables, grouped into Categories, `T-NN` IDs. State-table format
  kept as a documented alternative for multi-step scenarios.
- Contractual, customer-facing scenarios are explicitly distinguished from
  non-contractual developer implementation tests.
- `init-project` skill redesigned to scan filesystem first and infer defaults
  before asking questions — typically 0–3 questions instead of 12.
- `project_context.template.yaml` streamlined: Odoo DB credentials (`user`, `host`,
  `port`, `password`) and `qa_instance.url` removed — they come from `odoo_config.ini`.

## Planned / open
- Consider an `agents/AGENTS.md` note on non-functional requirements (workflow §8.8 gap).
- Nothing committed yet (per convention: ask before committing).
